This is the readme file for loglite cmake makefile generation.
First, define BOOST_INCLUDE environment variable with the path of the boost library.
Then generate the makefile with cmake and launch a make.
example:
  export BOOST_INCLUDE=/home/you/boost_1_35_0/
  cmake CMakeLists.txt
  make

Giddiyup!
